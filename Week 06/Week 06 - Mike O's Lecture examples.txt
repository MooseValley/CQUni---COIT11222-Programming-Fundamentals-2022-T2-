THIS WEEK: Week 06
* Week 06 Looping    <--- YOU ARE HERE !



Sentinel value - a key value / limit to how to how many times you want to loop

for (int k = 0; k < 10; k++)
{
    ::::
}

int k = 0;
while (k < 10)
{
    ::::
    k++;
}

The above 2 loops have the same effect - loop 10 times.
But there is 1 KEY difference - what is it ???

A.  k is available AFTER the while loop ends.

We can re-write the for loop to do the same (k is available after for loop ends):

int k = 0;
for (; k < 10; k++)
{
    ::::
}


for (;;;)


Stay thre HELL away from solutions.
because you will look at them and think "Oh that's looks easy"
and you wont try yourself
and you wont learn

Study Committment for this course is 12 hour per week MINIMUM.
At least 10 hours of that should be writing code, solving pronlems, exploring course topics.
If you fall behind or are struggling, you may need to do a LOT more than 12 hours pw.
